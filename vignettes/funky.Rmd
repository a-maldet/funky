This **R package** makes **functional programming**
easy and helps avoiding
**memory leaks** when using **closures** in R.

> Functional Programming In R Should Be FunKy

## Installation

```{r}
# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github('a-maldet/funky', build_opts = NULL)
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(funky)
```

## Available functions

- `restrict_fn_env()`: Restrict the environment of a function to the
  **optimal scope** and reduce its ancestry tree to the minimum. This
  is very important, because otherwise the functions created inside of a
  **closure** reference the **entire environment ancestry tree**.
  This may cause **memory leaks** and slow down your code.
- `eval_closure()`: A wrapper for `restrict_fn_env()`, which allows
  you to evaluate an expression inside of a closure, which has the
  **optimal scope**. This is important to **avoid memory leaks** when using
  **closures** in R.
- `get_call_args()`: Returns a named list holding all argument values of the
  current function call (including non-overwritten default values).
- `call_with_similar_args()`: Used inside of a function call in order
  to call another function using the same or similar calling
  arguments. This can **save a lot of code** when creating
  a function that is a mere **wrapper** of another function.
  For example, when developing R packages, the exported functions
  are often just wrappers.
